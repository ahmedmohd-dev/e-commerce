i was to use pooling but sasebew we will not use more than 100 emails
Pooling: Reuses a small set of open SMTP connections to send many emails, instead of opening a new connection for each email. This is faster and reduces connection overhead. You can set pool size (e.g., 5) and how many messages per connection.

The current UI leans more toward a desktop-first (PC-first) layout. While some components are responsive, the overall spacing and typography were designed with desktop dashboards in mind. If you’d like, I can help transition it toward a more mobile-first approach as we refresh the styling.
) More Notification Types / Events
Infrastructure was already generic (each notification has type, title, body, link, meta), so I wired more key events:
Orders:
Buyer gets order:placed, order:status, order:verified.
Seller gets order:new, order:status-admin, order:verified, order:seller-progress.
Translation Updates
Expanded the orders dictionary with every label used in confirmation/tracking flows (status text, CTAs, payment labels, error messages) for both English and Amharic, so future pages can reuse the same keys instead of hard‑coding strings. orders: {
orderId: "Order ID",
orderNumber: "Order Number",
orderNumberShort: "Order #",
...,
timeline: {
orderPlaced: "Order Placed",
paymentVerified: "Payment Verified",
...
},
paymentMethods: {
telebirr: "Telebirr",
paypal: "PayPal",
},
},
